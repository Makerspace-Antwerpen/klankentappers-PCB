## The goal
The goal of this project was to create a cheap mic pcb that can be used to measure soundlevels with inexpensive hardware. 
The PCB's shape is dictated by the housing. 

## The components
### INFINEON M69d120
This is your run of the mill PDM microphone. It was picked because of it's flat frequency response.
### ADAU 7002
This is a PDM to I2S converter chip. It converts the PDM signal of the microphone to a I2S signal that is usable by for example a raspberry pi or a variety of microcontrollers.
